{"name":"SharpDeo","tagline":"SharpDeo is a PCL lib for the .NET ecosystem","body":"### Welcome to SharpDeo's WebSite.\r\nThis page is the easiest way to discover the project. SharpDeo is PCL lib to connect to Aldeo's API.\r\n\r\n### PCL\r\nA key component of building cross-platform applications is being able to share code across various platform-specific projects. However, this is complicated by the fact that different platforms often use a different sub-set of the .NET Base Class Library (BCL), and therefore are actually built to a different .NET Core Library Profile. This means that each platform can only use class libraries that are targeted to the same profile, so they would appear to require separate class library projects for each platform.\r\n\r\n## Bug Reports & Feature Requests\r\n\r\nYou can help by reporting bugs, suggesting features, reviewing feature specifications or just by sharing your opinion.\r\n\r\nUse [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/aldeoeip/SharpDeo/issues) for all of that.\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
